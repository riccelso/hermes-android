# hermes-android

Give your AI agent hands. Remote Android device control for [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

## How it works

```
Phone (home WiFi)  ──WebSocket──>  Hermes Server (cloud)  <──HTTP──  AI Agent
                                   relay on port 8766
```

The phone connects **out** to your Hermes server — works behind any NAT, no port forwarding, no VPN, no USB. Just a 6-character pairing code.

## Repository Structure

This repo contains **two components**:

| Component | Path | Language | Purpose |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| **Android bridge app** | `hermes-android-bridge/` | Kotlin | Runs on the phone. Connects to server via WebSocket, executes commands via AccessibilityService |
| **Python toolset** | `tools/`, `tests/` | Python | Runs on the server. 42 `android_*` tools + WebSocket relay. Also lives in [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) as the production copy |

> **Note:** The Python code exists here for standalone development and testing (`pip install -e .`, `pytest`). The production copy is in the hermes-agent repo. The Android app does not use or depend on the Python files.

## Install as hermes-agent plugin (hermes-agent v0.3.0+)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raulvidis/hermes-android/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/plugins
cp -r hermes-android-plugin ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-android
```

Restart hermes — run `/plugins` to verify. Should show: `✓ hermes-android v0.5.0 (42 tools)`

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the bridge app on your phone

**Option A — Download the prebuilt APK (easiest).** Every push to `main` automatically
publishes a fresh debug APK to the [**Latest Build**](https://github.com/raulvidis/hermes-android/releases/tag/latest-build)
release. Download the `hermes-android-<version>.apk` asset from there and install it — either
by opening the file on the device (enable "Install unknown apps" for your browser/file
manager when prompted) or via `adb install hermes-android-*.apk`.

**Option B — Build from source:**
```bash
cd hermes-android-bridge
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/hermes-android-*.apk
```

> The APK is an unsigned **debug** build, which is why Android/Play Protect may warn on
> install — it is not yet published on the Play Store or F-Droid.

### 2. Grant permissions on the phone
- Open Hermes Bridge app
- Tap **Enable Accessibility Service** → find Hermes Bridge → toggle ON
- Tap **Enable Status Overlay** → grant permission
- Tap **Grant Screen Recording** → approve the system dialog (needed for `android_screen_record`)
- Grant additional runtime permissions in **Settings > Apps > Hermes Bridge > Permissions**:
  - **Microphone** — for `android_mic_record`
  - **Location** — for `android_location`
  - **Contacts** — for `android_search_contacts`
  - **SMS** — for `android_send_sms`
  - **Phone** — for `android_call` (direct dialing)
- Enable **Notification Listener** in **Settings > Apps > Special app access > Notification access** → enable Hermes Bridge (for `android_notifications` / `android_events`)

### 3. Connect to your Hermes server

Tell hermes (via Telegram, Discord, etc):
```
Connect to my phone, code is <CODE>
```
Where `<CODE>` is the 6-character pairing code shown in the app.

Hermes will reply with the server address. Enter it in the app and tap **Connect**.

> Full install detail (permission → tool mapping, AAOS, persistent systemd relay) lives in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

### 4. Done
The agent can now control your phone. Try: "open Instagram", "take a screenshot", "what apps do I have?"

## Android Automotive OS (Car Head Units)

The bridge app can run on Android Automotive OS (AAOS) car head units. Phone-specific features (SMS, calls, contacts) gracefully return errors when the hardware is unavailable.

### Installation

1. Get the APK: download `hermes-android-<version>.apk` from the [Latest Build release](https://github.com/raulvidis/hermes-android/releases/tag/latest-build), or build it with `cd hermes-android-bridge && ./gradlew assembleDebug`
2. Sideload via ADB: `adb install hermes-android-*.apk`
   - USB: connect directly to the head unit's USB port
   - WiFi: `adb connect <head-unit-ip>:5555` then install
3. Grant Accessibility Service: **Settings > Accessibility > Hermes Bridge > Enable**
4. Grant overlay permission: **Settings > Apps > Special access > Draw over apps > Hermes Bridge**
5. Skip phone-specific permissions (SMS, calls, contacts) — not applicable

### Connection

The car head unit needs network access to reach the relay server:

- **USB tethering** (recommended): `adb forward tcp:8766 tcp:8766`, then enter `http://localhost:8766` in the app
- **WiFi**: enter the relay server's `http://<ip>:8766` in the app (both devices on same network)

### Limitations

| Tool | Status on AAOS |
|------|---------------|
| `android_send_sms` | Not available — returns error |
| `android_call` | Not available — returns error |
| `android_search_contacts` | Not available — returns error |
| `android_location` | Depends on car unit GPS configuration |
| `android_screen_record` | May behave differently (restricted MediaProjection on some OEMs) |

All other tools (tap, swipe, type, screenshot, read screen, open apps, etc.) work normally.

## Permissions

| Permission | How to Grant | Required For |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Accessibility Service | App button → Settings > Accessibility | All tools (core requirement) |
| System Alert Window (Overlay) | App button → Settings > Draw over apps | Status overlay display |
| Screen Recording (MediaProjection) | App button → approve system dialog | `android_screen_record` |
| Microphone | Settings > Apps > Permissions > Microphone | `android_mic_record` |
| Location | Settings > Apps > Permissions > Location | `android_location` |

## Architecture

**Android app (Kotlin):**
- AccessibilityService reads the UI tree and performs taps/types/swipes
- WebSocket client (OkHttp) connects out to the Hermes server
- Ktor HTTP server for local/USB development
- Pairing code authentication
- Screenshot capture via AccessibilityService API
- Terminal-themed UI

**Server (Python):**
- WebSocket + HTTP relay (aiohttp) on port 8766
- Tools register into hermes-agent's tool registry
- Rate-limited authentication (5 attempts / 60s, then 5min block)
- Auto-detects server public IP for setup instructions

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details. Key points:
- Pairing code authentication with rate limiting
- Phone connects out (never directly exposed)
- Currently unencrypted (`ws://`) — use TLS proxy for production
- Full device access once paired — only connect to trusted servers

## Development

```bash
# Python tests
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/

# Android build
cd hermes-android-bridge
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Roadmap

This is a working prototype. The vision: **give Hermes its own phone** — a fully autonomous mobile presence.

Shipped milestones live in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) — notifications, clipboard,
direct SMS/calls, location, microphone recording, screen-wake key, text-to-speech,
and a persistent systemd relay are all in. What's still ahead:

### Upcoming
- TLS/WSS support for encrypted phone↔server communication
- Server-side call counter to prevent tool call loops
- Better error reporting (screenshot + annotated explanation on failure)
- File transfer — send files/photos between phone and server
- Multiple phones — connect more than one device to the same relay
- Scheduled automations — "every morning, check my commute price on Bolt"
- Event triggers — "when a notification arrives from this app, do X"
- Macro recording — watch a workflow once, replay it on demand
- Phone call capability — answer and speak in calls using TTS/STT
- Voice assistant mode — always-listening on the phone, responds via speaker
- Call handling — answer, take a message, relay a callback
- Local model execution — run small models (Qwen 0.5B, Gemma 2B) on-device
- Offline fallback — basic commands work without server using an on-device model
- Hybrid routing — simple tasks locally, complex tasks to the server
- On-device app adapters — fast structured parsing without server round-trips
- iOS support via Shortcuts/accessibility bridge
- Web dashboard for monitoring phone activity
- Cross-app workflows — "find a restaurant on Maps, share on WhatsApp, book an Uber there"
- Dedicated "Hermes Phone" — a phone that boots straight into agent mode
